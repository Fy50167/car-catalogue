## Car Catalogue

Car catalogue created with Next.js. Features API calls to display real, up-to-date information on cars with a variety of search filters. Note that it only displays the same stock image for every car since access to image APIs requires paid access.
Created in large part by following along on this Javascript Mastery tutorial: [Video Link](https://youtu.be/pUNSHPyVryU?si=XtrP2Ohgc7074zrP)
